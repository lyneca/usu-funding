                <h1>USU Funding Changes</h1>
                <p>
                    As of Febuary 2019, the USU has changed student pricing for
                    ACCESS membership:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>$0 membership fee</li>
                    <li>optional $45 'discount' price (for a 10% discount campus-wide)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This means that societies will likely see more registered
                    members attending their events, with more students
                    interested and able to join societies and less unregistered
                    students turning up to events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, they have also cut funding for society events.
                    Previously, societies were funded for $6 per ACCESS member
                    for on-campus events, or $4 for off-campus events, up until
                    breaking even. This is represented by the blue line on the
                    graph to the right.
                </p>
                <p>
                With the new funding scheme, societies are funded for <del>30%</del> 50%
                    of the total event cost for on-campus events (off-campus events stay
                    at 30%), plus $1 per USU member attending.  This is represented by the
                    red line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The USU also has the option to apply for a large grant of money
                    for camps, and another yearly grant for large events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The USU's Strategic Plan 2017-2020, and past annual reports
                    (including financial reports) can be downloaded
                    <a href="https://www.usu.edu.au/about-us.aspx">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Update 15/07/2019:</strong> As of the 5th of August 2019, on-campus
                    events have had their funding increased from 30% to 50%.
