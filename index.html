            <h1>USU Funding Changes</h1>
            <p>
                The USU has changed student pricing for ACCESS membership:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>$0 membership fee</li>
                <li>optional $45 'discount' price (for a 10% discount campus-wide)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                They have also cut funding for society events.
                Previously, societies were funded for $6 per ACCESS member
                for on-campus events, or $4 for off-campus events, up until
                breaking even. This is represented by the blue line on the
                graph to the right.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the new funding scheme, societies are funded for 30%
                of the total event cost, plus $1 per USU member attending.
                This is represented by the red line.
            </p>
